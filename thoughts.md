* My first take-away from the Mod 0 sessions is the calendaring. for me this is something I have always needed to work on so getting tips about doing it effectively were very helpful.  
My second take-away was Git. I think it is a really useful system, I liked the points about keeping it organized in such a way that you and whoever else can decipher what changes were made.

* First strategy I am going to use is from the calendaring, I am going to break up my time into smaller more manageable chunks in-order to direct my focus.

 * Second strategy I am going to implement is relying on my cohort for help.

* Shoutout to Cole for all his help with Git yesterday!
Shoutout to my girlfriend, family and friends for supporting my Turing adventure.

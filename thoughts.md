My first take-away from the Mod 0 sessions is the calendaring. for me this is something I have always needed to work on so getting tips about doing it effectively were very helpful.  
My second take-away was Git. I think it is a really useful system, I liked the points about keeping it organized in such a way that you and whoever else can decipher what changes were made.
